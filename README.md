# lightorgan-batacuda
Arduino controlled 8-relay light organ plays a batacuda

There is no long list of genres,
which can be played on 8 relays.
March is too square for an already square platform.
Bolero is better, but it is difficult to
implement monoton increasing volume with
8 channels of same rhythm instruments.
Finally, I voted on Batacuda, because there are some
dynamic patterns, which are interesging enough to
fill a cca. 3 minutes song: crescendo,
solo teheme echoed by the choir,
and tempo increase.
